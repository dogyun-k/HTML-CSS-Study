            Staring at the bottom of your glass
            Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
            But dreams come slow and they go so fast
            You see her when you close your eyes
            Maybe one day you'll understand why
            Everything you touch surely diesBut you only need the light when it's burning low
            Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
            Only know you love her when you let her go
            Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
            Only hate the road when you're missing home
            Only know you love her when you let her go
        </div>
